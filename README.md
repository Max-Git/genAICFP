### **SO DO I!**

I was so fed up reading the same abstract again and again that I asked this to chatgpt:  

> Could you write a short abstract that would describe a conference talk that speaks about how to use GenAI to generate the perfect abstract to submit to a conference call for paper. The abstract would insist on how the talk would unravel the use of GenAI as it's a trending thing in our industry.

I couldn't be happier with the answer :) 

## Title
Unleashing the Power of GenAI: Crafting the Perfect Conference Abstract
